This would be the typical cases we should fail, since Bar is refereced to a type with default
and we are trying to assign another default

Seems CUE is picking the default before eval it, it seems we can get the reference first and
check whether default exist there, if yes if the default also exist for the current cue object error out

Or should we just forbidden the disjunction between Enum and other types??
-- cue --
package cuetsy

AOrEnum: "foo" | "bar" | *"baz" @cuetsy(kind="enum")
Foo: {
  Bar: AOrEnum | *"ohai"
} @cuetsy(kind="interface")

-- err --
export enum AOrEnum {
  Bar = 'bar',
  Baz = 'baz',
  Foo = 'foo',
}
export const aOrEnumDefault: AOrEnum = AOrEnum.Baz
export interface Foo {
  Bar: AOrEnum | 'ohai';
}
export const fooDefault: Foo = {
  Bar: 'ohai',
}
